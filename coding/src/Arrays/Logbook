First Duplicate Value
    need to understand Q better
    use of set and index to get first duplicate
    need to check abs value solution with o(1) space

Overlappin intervals
    logic was correct but still lacking execution
    use list to add items even if its int[]
    its ok to check with first one and also try to get the q bteer - video
    solution was to have one element outside and update it and its ends to get the range
    In Java, when you modify an array through a reference, any other reference to that array sees the change.
    int[] currentInterval = sortedIntervals[0];
    mergedIntervals.add(currentInterval);
    so when I do add and currentInterval changes, list array also changes as its reference
