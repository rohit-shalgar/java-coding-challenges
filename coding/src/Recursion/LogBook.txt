Permutations
    Backtrack to avoid unexpected results
    be careful with conditions
    but overall looking good, time and space complexity needs to be studied more

PowerSet
    need to careful with for loop , concurrent mod exception
    and the length, otherwise infinite loop

BlackJack probability
    got messed up on float
    also the 4 difference logic was an issue
    be careful with adding the card drawn
    better logic is to be expected
