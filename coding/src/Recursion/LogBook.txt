Permutations
    Backtrack to avoid unexpected results
    be careful with conditions
    but overall looking good, time and space complexity needs to be studied more

PowerSet
    need to careful with for loop , concurrent mod exception
    and the length, otherwise infinite loop

BlackJack probability
    got messed up on float
    also the 4 difference logic was an issue
    be careful with adding the card drawn
    better logic is to be expected

DFS - Island perimeter
    when started to iterate found issue quick so be aware
    DFS rules:
        find dfs root - island , land with value 1
        then do dfs, have edge cases
        and mark as visited by marking it - 1 and then return 0 from them.
        also, variable - pass by value, create a new variable in dfs method
        track and return it.
