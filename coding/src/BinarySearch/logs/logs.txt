Find 3 largest nums (algoexpert)
    learned a new shifting techinque based on indexes
    if index is same assign otherwise one before is equal to one next
    learned min heap execution well now
    always check if Number is greater before updating.

Sorted matrix
    if its sorted see if you can come from back and reduce column or row based on values

Find range
    a boolean flag can be used to go left or right
    binary search is all about moving left or right w.r.t. mid index all the time
    in the range question - 1 behind or 1 after is not equal to the current one
    means out of range
    remember that
    so learned 2 techniques - boolean flag to traverse a direction
    and one before or one after is not equal or extreme ends are reached
    e.g 0 or length , means we are done with the range.
