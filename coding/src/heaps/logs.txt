RelativeRanks
    Understand q first well
    solve first the try to optimize
    heaps does complicate as you need index in output and its rank of all
    Heaps are more for top k , min k , ordering , scheduling etc
    also, heaps - priority queues work with collection
    int[] better sort

Top K elements subsequence
    technique - min heap and offer
    only storing k elements so that time and space complexity - log k
    offer(), poll()
    for operations where indexes are imp as well, store into int array
    or Map.entry and sort the keys
