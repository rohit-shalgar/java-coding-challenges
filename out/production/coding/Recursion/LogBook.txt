Permutations
    Backtrack to avoid unexpected results
    be careful with conditions
    but overall looking good, time and space complexity needs to be studied more

PowerSet
    need to careful with for loop , concurrent mod exception
    and the length, otherwise infinite loop

BlackJack probability
    got messed up on float
    also the 4 difference logic was an issue
    be careful with adding the card drawn
    better logic is to be expected

DFS - Island perimeter
    when started to iterate found issue quick so be aware
    DFS rules:
        find dfs root - island , land with value 1
        then do dfs, have edge cases
        and mark as visited by marking it - 1 and then return 0 from them.
        also, variable - pass by value, create a new variable in dfs method
        track and return it.

Max area Island
    was able to calculate briliantly using island as DFS root
    needed to be careful with copy paste and kept calling with row +1

Minesweper
    tried solving with memoize and marking board as V
    Never touch original board when you have to return it,
    maybe clone and use it if area is asked
    also, for 0 case could not resolve DFS
    later had to calculate adjusant mines if its 0 then DFS
    Also had to create a class with row and column and mark visited
    memoize was useless as each adjusant was updated anyway
    try it again
